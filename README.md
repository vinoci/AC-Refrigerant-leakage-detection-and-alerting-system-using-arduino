# AC-Refrigerant-leakage-detection-and-alerting-system-using-arduino
The main aim of this project is to alert the inmates who are using the AC room during the
night time when there is a leakage of freon and other harmful gases rarely from compressor.
Freon is a tasteless and odourless gas which is commonly used in AC for the purpose of cooling.
This is done with the help of components like tgs 832 A00 (a cfc sensor),an arduino and a buzzer.
